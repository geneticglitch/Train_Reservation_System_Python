# Train-Reservation-System--Python-
This Python script is a console-based railway management system. Users can log in or create an account, book and cancel tickets, and view their bookings. Administrators can add trains, list existing trains, and add stations and coaches to specific trains. The script interacts with a MySQL database using the pymysql library for data storage and retrieval.
